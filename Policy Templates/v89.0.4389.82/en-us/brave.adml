The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { "pattern": "$URL_PATTERN", "filter" : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { "ISSUER": { "CN": "$ISSUER_CN" } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the "ISSUER" and the "SUBJECT" sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with the "O" value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with a "OU" value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

Leaving the policy unset means there's no autoselection for any site.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=AutoSelectCertificateForUrls for more information about schema and formatting.

      <string id="LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled_Explain">Allows you to revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior.

See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies for full description.

When this policy is not set, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on the user's personal configuration for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature which may be set by a field trial or by enabling or disabling the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag, respectively.</string>

      <string id="WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls">Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to USB devices with the given vendor and product IDs.</string>
      <string id="WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls_Explain">Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

The USB permission model uses the requesting and embedding URLs to grant the requesting URL permission to access the USB device. The requesting URL can be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. So, the urls field can have up to 2 URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL, respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices is granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL, regardless of embedding status. The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting applies, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

URL patterns in this policy shouldn't conflict with those configured through WebUsbBlockedForUrls. If they do, this policy takes precedence over WebUsbBlockedForUrls and WebUsbAskForUrls.

      <string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlist">Configure extension installation allow list</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which extensions are not subject to the blocklist.

A blocklist value of * means all extensions are blocked and users can only install extensions listed in the allow list.

By default, all extensions are allowed. But, if you prohibited extensions by policy, use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlistDesc">Configure extension installation allow list</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist">Configure extension installation blocklist</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blocklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Brave.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklistDesc">Configure extension installation blocklist</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. Permissions are granted implicitly, including for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.)

Leaving the policy unset means no apps or extensions are autoinstalled, and users can uninstall any app or extension in Brave.

This policy superseeds ExtensionInstallBlocklist policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Brave automatically uninstalls it.

On Microsoft® Windows® instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension may be altered by users through developer tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on chrome://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the "update" URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate ). By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used. The "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

 Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito mode. Read about hosting extensions ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting ).

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallSources">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which URLs may install extensions, apps, and themes. Before Brave 21, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Brave would offer to install the file after a few warnings. Afterwards, such files must be downloaded and dragged to the Brave settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlocklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blocklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

Example value:

https://corp.mycompany.com/*</string>
      <string id="ExtensionInstallSourcesDesc">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string>
      <string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes">Configure allowed app/extension types</string>
      <string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes_Explain">Setting the policy controls which apps and extensions may be installed in Brave, which hosts they can interact with, and limits runtime access.

Leaving the policy unset results in no restrictions on the acceptable extension and app types.

Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

* "extension"

* "theme"

* "user_script"

* "hosted_app"

* "legacy_packaged_app"

* "platform_app"

See the Brave extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Versions earlier than 75 that use multiple comma separated extension IDs aren't supported and are skipped. The rest of the policy applies.

Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using ExtensionInstallForcelist.

Example value:

hosted_app</string>
      <string id="ExtensionAllowedTypesDesc">Configure allowed app/extension types</string>
      <string id="ExtensionSettings">Extension management settings</string>
      <string id="ExtensionSettings_Explain">Setting the policy controls extension management settings for Brave, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. The policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID "*", which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest ( http://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Configure_ExtensionSettings_policy ). If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the "update" URL specified in the ExtensionInstallForcelist policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is a Chrome Web Store url.

Note: For Windows® instances not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionSettings for more information about schema and formatting.

      <string id="BlockExternalExtensions">Blocks external extensions from being installed</string>
      <string id="BlockExternalExtensions_Explain">Controls external extensions installation.

Enabling this setting blocks external extensions from being installed.

Disabling this setting or leaving it unset allows external extensions to be installed.

External extensions and their installation are documented at https://developer.chrome.com/apps/external_extensions.

      <string id="GoogleCast_group">Google Cast</string>
      <string id="EnableMediaRouter">Enable Google Cast</string>
      <string id="EnableMediaRouter_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns on Google Cast, which users can launch from the app menu, page context menus, media controls on Cast-enabled websites, and (if shown) the Cast toolbar icon.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off Google Cast.</string>
      <string id="ShowCastIconInToolbar">Show the Google Cast toolbar icon</string>
      <string id="ShowCastIconInToolbar_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled displays the Cast toolbar icon on the toolbar or the overflow menu, and users can't remove it.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset lets users pin or remove the icon through its contextual menu.

If the policy EnableMediaRouter is set to Disabled, then this policy's value has no effect, and the toolbar icon doesn't appear.</string>
      <string id="HTTPAuthentication_group">HTTP authentication</string>
      <string id="AuthSchemes">Supported authentication schemes</string>
      <string id="AuthSchemes_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which HTTP authentication schemes Brave supports.

Leaving the policy unset employs all 4 schemes.

Valid values:

* basic

* digest

* ntlm

* negotiate

Note: Separate multiple values with commas.

Example value: basic,digest,ntlm,negotiate</string>
      <string id="DisableAuthNegotiateCnameLookup">Disable CNAME lookup when negotiating Kerberos authentication</string>
      <string id="DisableAuthNegotiateCnameLookup_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled skips CNAME lookup. The server name is used as entered when generating the Kerberos SPN.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means CNAME lookup determines the canonical name of the server when generating the Kerberos SPN.</string>
      <string id="EnableAuthNegotiatePort">Include non-standard port in Kerberos SPN</string>
      <string id="EnableAuthNegotiatePort_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled and entering a nonstandard port (in other words, a port other than 80 or 443) includes it in the generated Kerberos SPN.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the generated Kerberos SPN won't include a port.</string>
      <string id="BasicAuthOverHttpEnabled">Allow Basic authentication for HTTP</string>
      <string id="BasicAuthOverHttpEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will allow Basic authentication challenges received over non-secure HTTP.

Setting the policy to Disabled forbids non-secure HTTP requests from using the Basic authentication scheme; only secure HTTPS is allowed.</string>
      <string id="AuthServerAllowlist">Authentication server allowlist</string>
      <string id="AuthServerAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which servers should be allowed for integrated authentication. Integrated authentication is only on when Brave gets an authentication challenge from a proxy or from a server in this permitted list.

Leaving the policy unset means Brave tries to detect if a server is on the intranet. Only then will it respond to IWA requests. If a server is detected as internet, then Brave ignores IWA requests from it.

Note: Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards, *, are allowed.

Example value: *.example.com,example.com</string>
      <string id="AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist">Kerberos delegation server allowlist</string>
      <string id="AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy assigns servers that Brave may delegate to. Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards, *, are allowed.

Leaving the policy unset means Brave won't delegate user credentials, even if a server is detected as intranet.

Example value: foobar.example.com</string>
      <string id="AllowCrossOriginAuthPrompt">Cross-origin HTTP Authentication prompts</string>
      <string id="AllowCrossOriginAuthPrompt_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled allows third-party images on a page to show an authentication prompt.

 Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset renders third-party images unable to show an authentication prompt.

Typically, this policy is Disabled as a phishing defense.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcher_group">Legacy Browser Support</string>
      <string id="AlternativeBrowserPath">Alternative browser to launch for configured websites.</string>
      <string id="AlternativeBrowserPath_Explain">Setting the policy controls which command to use to open URLs in an alternative browser. The policy can be set to one of ${ie}, ${firefox}, ${safari}, ${opera}, ${edge} or a file path. When this policy is set to a file path, that file is used as an executable file. ${ie} is only available on Microsoft® Windows®. ${safari} and ${edge} are only available on Microsoft® Windows® and macOS.

Leaving the policy unset puts a platform-specific default in use: Internet Explorer® for Microsoft® Windows®, or Safari® for macOS. On Linux®, launching an alternative browser will fail.

Example value: ${ie}</string>
      <string id="AlternativeBrowserParameters">Command-line parameters for the alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="AlternativeBrowserParameters_Explain">Setting the policy to a list of strings means each string is passed to the alternative browser as separate command-line parameters. On Microsoft® Windows®, the parameters are joined with spaces. On macOS and Linux®, a parameter can have spaces and still be treated as a single parameter.

If an parameter contains ${url}, ${url} is replaced with the URL of the page to open. If no parameter contains ${url}, the URL is appended at the end of the command line.

Environment variables are expanded. On Microsoft® Windows®, %ABC% is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable. On macOS and Linux®, ${ABC} is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable.

Leaving the policy unset means only the URL is passed as a command-line parameter.

Example value:

-foreground
-new-window
${url}
-profile
%HOME%\browser_profile</string>
      <string id="AlternativeBrowserParametersDesc">Command-line parameters for the alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherChromePath">Path to Chrome for switching from the alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherChromePath_Explain">This policy controls the command to use to open URLs in Brave when switching from Internet Explorer®. This policy can be set to an executable file path or ${chrome} to autodetect the location of Brave.

Leaving the policy unset means Internet Explorer® autodetects Brave's own executable path when launching Brave from Internet Explorer.

Note: If the Legacy Browser Support add-in for Internet Explorer® isn't installed, this policy has no effect.

Example value: ${chrome}</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherChromeParameters">Command-line parameters for switching from the alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherChromeParameters_Explain">Setting the policy to a list of strings means the strings are joined with spaces and passed from Internet Explorer® to Brave as command-line parameters. If an parameter contains ${url}, ${url} is replaced with the URL of the page to open. If no parameter contains ${url}, the URL is appended at the end of the command line.

Environment variables are expanded. On Microsoft® Windows®, %ABC% is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable.

Leaving the policy unset means Internet Explorer® only passes the URL to Brave as a command-line parameter.

Note: If the Legacy Browser Support add-in for Internet Explorer® isn't installed, this policy has no effect.

Example value:

--force-dark-mode</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherChromeParametersDesc">Command-line parameters for switching from the alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherDelay">Delay before launching alternative browser (milliseconds)</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherDelay_Explain">Setting the policy to a number has Brave show a message for that number of milliseconds, then it opens an alternative browser.

Leaving the policy unset or set to 0 means navigating to a designated URL immediately opens it in an alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherEnabled">Enable the Legacy Browser Support feature.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Brave will try to launch some URLs in an alternate browser, such as Internet Explorer®. This feature is set using the policies in the Legacy Browser support group.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means Brave won't try to launch designated URLs in an alternate browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl">URL of an XML file that contains URLs to load in an alternative browser.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl_Explain">Setting the policy to a valid URL has Brave download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy.

Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means Brave doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for switching browsers.

Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer®. Read more on Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy ( https://docs.microsoft.com/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/what-is-enterprise-mode)

Example value: http://example.com/sitelist.xml</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl">URL of an XML file that contains URLs that should never trigger a browser switch.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl_Explain">Setting the policy to a valid URL has Brave download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist policy. These policies prevent Brave and the alternative browser from opening one another.

Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means Brave doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for not switching browsers.

Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer®. Read more on Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy ( https://docs.microsoft.com/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/what-is-enterprise-mode )

Example value: http://example.com/greylist.xml</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherKeepLastChromeTab">Keep last tab open in Chrome.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherKeepLastChromeTab_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset has Brave keep at least one tab open, after switching to an alternate browser.

Setting the policy to Disabled has Brave close the tab after switching to an alternate browser, even if it was the last tab. This causes Brave to exit completely.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlList">Websites to open in alternative browser</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlList_Explain">Setting the policy controls the list of websites to open in an alternative browser. Each item is treated as a rule for something to open in an alternative browser. Brave uses those rules when choosing if a URL should open in an alternative browser. When the Internet Explorer® add-in is on, Internet Explorer® switches back to Brave when the rules don't match. If rules contradict each other, Brave uses the most specific rule.

Leaving the policy unset adds no websites to the list.

Note: Elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist and BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl policies.

Example value:

ie.com
!open-in-chrome.ie.com
foobar.com/ie-only/</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlListDesc">Websites to open in alternative browser</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist">Websites that should never trigger a browser switch.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist_Explain">Setting the policy controls the list of websites that will never cause a browser switch. Each item is treated as a rule. Those rules that match won't open an alternative browser. Unlike the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy, rules apply to both directions. When the Internet Explorer® add-in is on, it also controls whether Internet Explorer® should open these URLs in Brave.

Leaving the policy unset adds no websites to the list.

Note: Elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl policy.

Example value:

ie.com
!open-in-chrome.ie.com
foobar.com/ie-only/</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylistDesc">Websites that should never trigger a browser switch.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist">Use Internet Explorer's SiteList policy for Legacy Browser Support.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist_Explain">This policy controls whether to load rules from Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy.

When this policy is set to true, Brave reads Internet Explorer®'s SiteList to obtain the site list's URL. Brave then downloads the site list from that URL, and applies the rules as if they had been configured with the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy.

When this policy is false or unset, Brave does not use Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy as a source of rules for switching browsers.

      <string id="NativeMessaging_group">Native Messaging</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingBlocklist">Configure native messaging blocklist</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingBlocklist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which native messaging hosts shouldn't be loaded. A deny list value of * means all native messaging hosts are denied, unless they're explicitly allowed.

Leaving the policy unset means Brave loads all installed native messaging hosts.

Example value:

com.native.messaging.host.name1
com.native.messaging.host.name2</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingBlocklistDesc">Configure native messaging blocklist</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingAllowlist">Configure native messaging allowlist</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which native messaging hosts aren't subject to the deny list. A deny list value of * means all native messaging hosts are denied, unless they're explicitly allowed.

All native messaging hosts are allowed by default. But, if all native messaging hosts are denied by policy, the admin can use the allow list to change that policy.

Example value:

com.native.messaging.host.name1
com.native.messaging.host.name2</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingAllowlistDesc">Configure native messaging allowlist</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingUserLevelHosts">Allow user-level Native Messaging hosts (installed without admin permissions)</string>
      <string id="NativeMessagingUserLevelHosts_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Brave can use native messaging hosts installed at the user level.

Setting the policy to Disabled means Brave can only use these hosts if installed at the system level.</string>
      <string id="PasswordManager_group">Password manager</string>
      <string id="PasswordManagerEnabled">Enable saving passwords to the password manager</string>
      <string id="PasswordManagerEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means users have Brave remember passwords and provide them the next time they sign in to a site.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't save new passwords, but previously saved passwords will still work.

If the policy is set, users can't change it in Brave. If not set, the user can turn off password saving.</string>
      <string id="PasswordLeakDetectionEnabled">Enable leak detection for entered credentials</string>
      <string id="PasswordLeakDetectionEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled lets users have Brave check whether usernames and passwords entered were part of a leak.

If the policy is set, users can't change it in Brave. If not set, credential leak checking is allowed, but the user can turn it off.

This behavior will not trigger if Safe Browsing is disabled (either by policy or by the user). In order to force Safe Browsing on, use the SafeBrowsingEnabled policy or the SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel policy.</string>
      <string id="Printing_group">Printing</string>
      <string id="PrintingEnabled">Enable printing</string>
      <string id="PrintingEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users print in Brave, and users can't change this setting.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't print from Brave. Printing is off in the three dots menu, extensions, and JavaScript applications.</string>
      <string id="CloudPrintProxyEnabled">Enable Google Cloud Print proxy</string>
      <string id="CloudPrintProxyEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets Brave act as a proxy between Google Cloud Printand legacy printers connected to the machine. Using their Google Account, users may turn on the cloud print proxy by authentication.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't turn on the proxy, and the machine can't share its printers with Google Cloud Print.</string>
      <string id="PrintingAllowedBackgroundGraphicsModes">Restrict background graphics printing mode</string>
      <string id="PrintingAllowedBackgroundGraphicsModes_Explain">Restricts background graphics printing mode. Unset policy is treated as no restriction.

Example value: enabled</string>
      <string id="PrintingAllowedBackgroundGraphicsModes_any">Allow printing both with and without background graphcis</string>
      <string id="PrintingAllowedBackgroundGraphicsModes_enabled">Allow printing only with background graphics</string>

      <string id="PrintingBackgroundGraphicsDefault_disabled">Disable background graphics printing mode by default</string>
      <string id="PrintingPaperSizeDefault">Default printing page size</string>
      <string id="PrintingPaperSizeDefault_Explain">Overrides default printing page size.

name should contain one of the listed formats or 'custom' if required paper size is not in the list. If 'custom' value is provided custom_size property should be specified. It describes the desired height and width in micrometers. Otherwise custom_size property shouldn't be specified. Policy that violates these rules is ignored.

If the page size is unavailable on the printer chosen by the user this policy is ignored.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=PrintingPaperSizeDefault for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

    "height": 297000
  }, 
  "name": "custom"
}</string>
      <string id="CloudPrintSubmitEnabled">Enable submission of documents to Google Cloud Print</string>
      <string id="CloudPrintSubmitEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users print to Google Cloud Print from the Brave print dialog. Brave can submit documents to Google Cloud Print for printing. This doesn't prevent users from submitting print jobs on websites.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't print to Google Cloud Print from the Brave print dialog.

In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, this policy must be set to Enabled and cloud must not be included in the PrinterTypeDenyList policy.</string>
      <string id="DisablePrintPreview">Disable Print Preview</string>
      <string id="DisablePrintPreview_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled has Brave open the system print dialog instead of the built-in print preview when users request a printout.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset has print commands trigger the print preview screen.</string>
      <string id="PrintHeaderFooter">Print Headers and Footers</string>
      <string id="PrintHeaderFooter_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled turns headers and footers on in print preview. Setting the policy to Disabled turns them off in print preview.

If you set the policy, users can't change it. If unset, users decides whether headers and footers appear.</string>
      <string id="DefaultPrinterSelection">Default printer selection rules</string>
      <string id="DefaultPrinterSelection_Explain">Setting the policy sets the rules for selecting the default printer in Brave, overriding the default rules. Printer selection occurs the first time users try to print, when Brave seeks a printer matching the specified attributes. In case of a less than perfect match, Brave can be set to select any matching printer, depending on the order printers are discovered.

Leaving the policy unset or set to attributes for which there's no match means the built-in PDF printer is the default. If there's no PDF printer, Brave defaults to none.

Printers connected to Google Cloud Print are considered "cloud", the rest of the printers are classified as "local".

Note: Omitting a field means all values match. For example, not specifying connectivity causes Print Preview to start discovery of all kinds of printers, "local" and "cloud". Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax, and matches are case sensistive.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=DefaultPrinterSelection for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value: { "kind": "cloud", "idPattern": ".*public", "namePattern": ".*Color" }</string>
      <string id="PrintPreviewUseSystemDefaultPrinter">Use System Default Printer as Default</string>
      <string id="PrintPreviewUseSystemDefaultPrinter_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Brave uses the OS default printer as the default destination for print preview.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means Brave uses the most recently used printer as the default destination for print preview.</string>
      <string id="PrinterTypeDenyList">Disable printer types on the deny list</string>
      <string id="PrinterTypeDenyList_Explain">The printers of types placed on the deny list will be disabled from being discovered or having their capabilities fetched.

Placing all printer types on the deny list effectively disables printing, as there would be no available destinations to send a document for printing.

Including cloud on the deny list has the same effect as setting the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy to false. In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy must be set to true and cloud must not be on the deny list.

If the policy is not set, or is set to an empty list, all printer types will be available for discovery.

Extension printers are also known as print provider destinations, and include any destination that belongs to a Brave extension.

Local printers are also known as native printing destinations, and include destinations available to the local machine and shared network printers.

Example value:

cloud
privet</string>
      <string id="PrinterTypeDenyListDesc">Disable printer types on the deny list</string>
      <string id="PrintRasterizationMode">Print Rasterization Mode</string>
      <string id="PrintRasterizationMode_Explain">Controls how Brave prints on Windows.

When printing to a non-PostScript printer on Windows, sometimes print jobs need to be rasterized to print correctly.

When this policy is set to Full, Brave will do full page rasterization if necessary.

When this policy is set to Fast, Brave will avoid rasterization if possible, reducing the amount of rasterization can help reduce print job sizes and increase printing speed.

When this policy is not set, Brave will be in Full mode.</string>

      <string id="RemoteAccess_group">Remote access</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList">Configure the required domain names for remote access clients</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the client domain names that are imposed on remote access clients, and users can't change them. Only clients from one of the specified domains can connect to the host.

Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset applies the default policy for the connection type. For remote assistance, this allows clients from any domain to connect to the host. For anytime remote access, only the host owner can connect.

See also RemoteAccessHostDomainList.

Note: This setting overrides RemoteAccessHostClientDomain, if present.

Example value:

      <string id="RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal">Enable firewall traversal from remote access host</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows the usage of STUN servers, letting remote clients discover and connect to this machine, even if separated by a firewall.

Setting the policy to Disabled when outgoing UDP connections are filtered by the firewall means the machine only allows connections from client machines within the local network.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostDomainList">Configure the required domain names for remote access hosts</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostDomainList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the host domain names that are imposed on remote access hosts, and users can't change them. Hosts can be shared only using accounts registered on one of the specified domain names.

Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset means hosts can be shared using any account.

See also RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList.

Note: This setting will override RemoteAccessHostDomain, if present.

Example value:

my-awesome-domain.com
my-auxiliary-domain.com</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostDomainListDesc">Configure the required domain names for remote access hosts</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostRequireCurtain">Enable curtaining of remote access hosts</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostRequireCurtain_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled turns off remote access hosts' physical input and output devices during a remote connection.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset lets both local and remote users interact with the host while it's shared.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowClientPairing">Enable or disable PIN-less authentication for remote access hosts</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowClientPairing_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users pair clients and hosts at connection time, eliminating the need to enter a PIN every time.

Setting the policy to Disabled makes this feature unavailable.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnection">Enable the use of relay servers by the remote access host</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnection_Explain">If RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal is set to Enabled, setting RemoteAccessHostAllowRelayedConnectionto Enabled or leaving it unset allows the use of remote clients to use relay servers to connect to this machine when a direct connection is not available, for example, because of firewall restrictions.

Setting the policy to Disabled doesn't turn remote access off, but only allows connections from the same network (not NAT traversal or relay).</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostUdpPortRange">Restrict the UDP port range used by the remote access host</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostUdpPortRange_Explain">Setting the policy restricts the UDP port range used by the remote access host in this machine.

Leaving the policy unset or set to an empty string means the remote access host can use any available port.

Note: If RemoteAccessHostFirewallTraversal is Disabled, the remote access host will use UDP ports in the 12400-12409 range.

Example value: 12400-12409</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowUiAccessForRemoteAssistance">Allow remote users to interact with elevated windows in remote assistance sessions</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowUiAccessForRemoteAssistance_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means the remote assistance host runs in a process with uiAccess permissions. This lets remote users interact with elevated windows on the local user's desktop.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the remote assistance host runs in the user's context, and remote users can't interact with elevated windows on the desktop.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowFileTransfer">Allow remote access users to transfer files to/from the host</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowFileTransfer_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset allows users connected to a remote access host to transfer files between the client and the host. This doesn't apply to remote assistance connections, which don't support file transfer.

Setting the policy to Disabled disallows file transfer.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRemoteAccessConnections">Allow remote access connections to this machine</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostAllowRemoteAccessConnections_Explain">If this policy is disabled, the remote access host service cannot be started or configured to accept incoming connections.  This policy does not affect remote support scenarios.

This policy has no effect if it is set to true, left empty, or is not set.</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostMaximumSessionDurationMinutes">Maximum session duration allowed for remote access connections</string>
      <string id="RemoteAccessHostMaximumSessionDurationMinutes_Explain">If this policy is set, remote access connections will automatically disconnect after the number of minutes defined in the policy have elapsed. This does not prevent the client from reconnecting after the maximum session duration has been reached. Setting the policy to a value that is not within the min/max range may prevent the host from starting. This policy does not affect remote support scenarios.

This policy has no effect if it is not set. In this case, remote access connections will have no maximum duration on this machine.</string>

Setting the policy to Disabled means reports are never sent.

If you set this policy, users can't change it. If not set, users can decide whether to send reports or not.

      <string id="SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel">Safe Browsing Protection Level</string>
      <string id="SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel_Explain">Allows you to control whether Brave's Safe Browsing feature is enabled and the mode it operates in.

If this policy is set to 'NoProtection' (value 0), Safe Browsing is never active.

If this policy is set to 'StandardProtection' (value 1, which is the default), Safe Browsing is always active in the standard mode.

If this policy is set to 'EnhancedProtection' (value 2), Safe Browsing is always active in the enhanced mode, which provides better security, but requires sharing more browsing information with Google.

If you set this policy as mandatory, users cannot change or override the Safe Browsing setting in Brave.

If this policy is left not set, Safe Browsing will operate in Standard Protection mode but users can change this setting.

It won't check them for dangerous resources such as phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Safe Browsing's download protection service won't check downloads hosted on these domains. Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

      <string id="PasswordProtectionWarningTrigger">Password protection warning trigger</string>
      <string id="PasswordProtectionWarningTrigger_Explain">Setting the policy lets you control the triggering of password protection warning. Password protection alerts users when they reuse their protected password on potentially suspicious sites.

Use PasswordProtectionLoginURLs and PasswordProtectionChangePasswordURL to set which password to protect.

If this policy is set to:

* PasswordProtectionWarningOff, no password protection warning will be shown.

* PasswordProtectionWarningOnPasswordReuse, password protection warning will be shown when the user reuses their protected password on a non-whitelisted site.

* PasswordProtectionWarningOnPhishingReuse, password protection warning will be shown when the user reuses their protected password on a phishing site.

Leaving the policy unset has the password protection service only protect Google passwords, but users can change this setting.</string>

      <string id="PasswordProtectionLoginURLs">Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service should capture salted hashes of passwords.</string>
      <string id="PasswordProtectionLoginURLs_Explain">Setting the policy sets the list of enterprise login URLs (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only). Password protection service will capture salted hashes of passwords on these URLs and use them for password reuse detection. For Brave to correctly capture password salted hashes, ensure your sign-in pages follow these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

Turning this setting off or leaving it unset means the password protection service only captures the password salted hashes on https://accounts.google.com.

The password protection service sends users to the URL (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only) you designate through this policy. For Brave to correctly capture the salted hash of the new password on this change password page, make sure your change password page follows these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

      <string id="ShowHomeButton">Show Home button on toolbar</string>
      <string id="ShowHomeButton_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled shows the Home button on Brave's toolbar. Setting the policy to Disabled keeps the Home button from appearing.

If you set the policy, users can't change it in Brave. If not set, users chooses whether to show the Home button.</string>
      <string id="HomepageLocation">Configure the home page URL</string>
      <string id="HomepageLocation_Explain">Setting the policy sets the default homepage URL in Brave. You open the homepage using the Home button. On desktop, the RestoreOnStartup policies control the pages that open on startup.

If the homepage is set to the New Tab Page, by the user or HomepageIsNewTabPage, this policy has no effect.

 The URL needs a standard scheme, such as http://example.com or https://example.com. When this policy is set, users can't change their homepage URL in Brave.

Leaving both HomepageLocation and HomepageIsNewTabPage unset lets users choose their homepage.

      <string id="HomepageIsNewTabPage">Use New Tab Page as homepage</string>
      <string id="HomepageIsNewTabPage_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled makes the New Tab page the user's homepage, ignoring any homepage URL location. Setting the policy to Disabled means that their homepage is never the New Tab page, unless the user's homepage URL is set to chrome://newtab.

If you set the policy, users can't change their homepage type in Brave. If not set, the user decides whether or not the New Tab page is their homepage.

      <string id="NewTabPageLocation">Configure the New Tab page URL</string>
      <string id="NewTabPageLocation_Explain">Setting the policy configures the default New Tab page URL and prevents users from changing it.

The New Tab page opens with new tabs and windows.

This policy doesn't decide which pages open on start up. Those are controlled by the RestoreOnStartup policies. This policy does affect the homepage, if that's set to open the New Tab page, as well as the startup page if it's set to open the New Tab page.

It is a best practice to provide fully canonicalized URL, if the URL is not fully canonicalized Brave will default to https://.

Leaving the policy unset or empty puts the default New Tab page in use.

      <string id="AccessibilityImageLabelsEnabled">Enable Get Image Descriptions from Google.</string>
      <string id="AccessibilityImageLabelsEnabled_Explain">The Get Image Descriptions from Google
accessibility feature enables visually-impaired screen reader users to
get descriptions of unlabeled images on the web. Users who choose to enable it
will have the option of using an anonymous Google service to provide
automatic descriptions for unlabeled images they encounter on the web.

If this feature is enabled, the content of images will be sent to Google
servers in order to generate a description. No cookies or other user
data is sent, and Google does not save or log any image content.

If this policy is set to true, the
Get Image Descriptions from Google
feature will be enabled, though it will only affect users who are using a
screen reader or other similar assistive technology.

If this policy is set to false, users will not have the option of enabling
the feature.

      <string id="AdvancedProtectionAllowed_Explain">This policy controls whether users enrolled in the Advanced Protection program receive extra protections. Some of these features may involve the sharing of data with Google (for example, Advanced Protection users will be able to send their downloads to Google for malware scanning). If set to True or not set, enrolled users will receive extra protections. If set to False, Advanced Protection users will receive only the standard consumer features.</string>
      <string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory">Enable deleting browser and download history</string>
      <string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means browser history and download history can be deleted in Chrome, and users can't change this setting.

Setting the policy to Disabled means browser history and download history can't be deleted. Even with this policy off, the browsing and download history are not guaranteed to be retained. Users may be able to edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may expire or archive any or all history items at any time.</string>
      <string id="AllowDinosaurEasterEgg">Allow Dinosaur Easter Egg Game</string>
      <string id="AllowDinosaurEasterEgg_Explain">Setting the policy to True allows users to play the dinosaur game. Setting the policy to False means users can't play the dinosaur easter egg game when device is offline.

Leaving the policy unset means users can't play the game on enrolled Brave OS, but can under other circumstances.</string>
      <string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs">Allow invocation of file selection dialogs</string>
      <string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Chrome can display, and users can open, file selection dialogs.

Setting the policy to Disabled means that whenever users perform actions provoking a file selection dialog, such as importing bookmarks, uploading files, and saving links, a message appears instead. The user is assumed to have clicked Cancel on the file selection dialog.</string>
      <string id="AllowSyncXHRInPageDismissal">Allows a page to perform synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.</string>
      <string id="AllowSyncXHRInPageDismissal_Explain">This policy allows an admin to specify that a page may send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

When the policy is set to enabled, pages are allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

When the policy is set to disabled or not set, pages are not allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

      <string id="AllowedDomainsForApps">Define domains allowed to access G Suite</string>
      <string id="AllowedDomainsForApps_Explain">Setting the policy turns on Chrome's restricted sign-in feature in G Suite and prevents users from changing this setting. Users can only access Google tools using accounts from the specified domains (to allow gmail or googlemail accounts, add consumer_accounts to the list of domains). This setting prevents users from signing in and adding a Secondary Account on a managed device that requires Google authentication, if that account doesn't belong to one of the explicitly allowed domains.

Leaving this setting empty or unset means users can access G Suite with any account.

Users cannot change or override this setting.

Note: This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.

Example value: managedchrome.com,example.com</string>
      <string id="AlternateErrorPagesEnabled">Enable alternate error pages</string>
      <string id="AlternateErrorPagesEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True means Brave uses alternate error pages built into (such as "page not found"). Setting the policy to False means Brave never uses alternate error pages.

      <string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally">Always Open PDF files externally</string>
      <string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally_Explain">Setting the policy to True turns the internal PDF viewer off in Brave, treats PDF files as a download, and lets users open PDFs with the default application.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means that unless users turns off the PDF plugin, it will open PDF files.</string>
      <string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled">Enable Ambient Authentication for profile types.</string>
      <string id="AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled_Explain">Configuring this policy will allow/disallow ambient authentication for Incognito and Guest profiles in Brave.

Ambient Authentication is http authentication with default credentials if explicit credentials are not provided via NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate challenge/response schemes.

Setting the RegularOnly (value 0), allows ambient authentication for Regular sessions only. Incognito and Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the IncognitoAndRegular (value 1), allows ambient authentication for Incognito and Regular sessions. Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the GuestAndRegular (value 2), allows ambient authentication for Guest and Regular sessions. Incognito sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

Setting the  All (value 3), allows ambient authentication for all sessions.

Note that, ambient authentication is always allowed on regular profiles.

In Brave version 81 and later, if the policy is left not set, ambient authentication will be enabled in regular sessions only.</string>

      <string id="AppCacheForceEnabled">Allows the AppCache feature to be re-enabled even if it is off by default.</string>
      <string id="AppCacheForceEnabled_Explain">If set to true, this will force AppCache to be enabled, even when AppCache in Chrome is not available by default.

If unset or set to false, AppCache will follow Chrome's defaults.</string>
      <string id="ApplicationLocaleValue">Application locale</string>
      <string id="ApplicationLocaleValue_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the locale Brave uses.

Turning it off or leaving it unset means the locale will be the first valid locale from:
1) The user specified locale (if configured).
2) The system locale.
3) The fallback locale (en-US).

Example value: en</string>
      <string id="AudioCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny audio capture</string>
      <string id="AudioCaptureAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means that, with the exception of URLs set in the AudioCaptureAllowedUrls list, users get prompted for audio capture access.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off prompts, and audio capture is only available to URLs set in the AudioCaptureAllowedUrls list.

Note: The policy affects all audio input (not just the built-in microphone).</string>
      <string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls">URLs that will be granted access to audio capture devices without prompt</string>
      <string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Setting the policy means you specify the URL list whose patterns get matched to the security origin of the requesting URL. A match grants access to audio capture devices without prompt

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

Example value:

      <string id="AudioSandboxEnabled">Allow the audio sandbox to run</string>
      <string id="AudioSandboxEnabled_Explain">This policy controls the audio process sandbox.
If this policy is enabled, the audio process will run sandboxed.
If this policy is disabled, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.
If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which may differ per platform.
This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.</string>
      <string id="AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins">Define a list of protocols that can launch an external application from listed origins without prompting the user</string>
      <string id="AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins_Explain">Allows you to set a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns, that can launch an external application without prompting the user. The trailing separator should not be included when listing the protocol, so list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

If this policy is set, a protocol will only be permitted to launch an external application without prompting by policy if the protocol is listed, and the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list. If either condition is false the external protocol launch prompt will not be omitted by policy.

If this policy is not set, no protocols can launch without a prompt by default. Users may opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox policy is set to Disabled. This policy has no impact on per-protocol/per-site prompt exemptions set by users.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the 'URLBlocklist' policy, which are documented at http://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

      <string id="AutoOpenAllowedForURLs">URLs where AutoOpenFileTypes can apply</string>
      <string id="AutoOpenAllowedForURLs_Explain">List of URLs specifying which urls AutoOpenFileTypes will apply to. This policy has no impact on automatically open values set by users.

If this policy is set, files will only automatically open by policy if the url is part of this set and the file type is listed in AutoOpenFileTypes. If either condition is false the download won't automatically open by policy.

If this policy isn't set, all downloads where the file type is in AutoOpenFileTypes will automatically open.

A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

Example value:

      <string id="AutoOpenFileTypes_Explain">List of file types that should be automatically opened on download. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list "txt" instead of ".txt".

Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled safe browsing checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

If this policy isn't set, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

      <string id="AutoplayAllowed">Allow media autoplay</string>
      <string id="AutoplayAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to True lets Brave autoplay media. Setting the policy to False stops Brave from autoplaying media.

 By default, Brave doesn't autoplay media. But, for certain URL patterns, you can use the AutoplayAllowlist policy to change this setting.

If this policy changes while Brave is running, it only applies to newly opened tabs.</string>
      <string id="AutoplayAllowlist">Allow media autoplay on a whitelist of URL patterns</string>

      <string id="BackgroundModeEnabled">Continue running background apps when Brave is closed</string>
      <string id="BackgroundModeEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled turns background mode on. In backgroudn mode, a Brave process is started on OS sign-in and keeps running when the last browser window is closed, allowing background apps and the browsing session to remain active, including any session cookies. The background process displays an icon in the system tray and can always be closed from there.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns background mode off.

If you set the policy, users can't change it in the browser settings. If unset, background mode is off at first, but users can change it.</string>
      <string id="BlockThirdPartyCookies">Block third party cookies</string>
      <string id="BlockThirdPartyCookies_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled prevents webpage elements that aren't from the domain that's in the browser's address bar from setting cookies. Setting the policy to Disabled lets those elements set cookies and prevents users from changing this setting.

Leaving it unset turns third-party cookies on, but users can change this setting.</string>
      <string id="BookmarkBarEnabled">Enable Bookmark Bar</string>
      <string id="BookmarkBarEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True displays a bookmark bar in Brave. Setting the policy to False means users never see the bookmark bar.

      <string id="BrowserGuestModeEnforced">Enforce browser guest mode</string>
      <string id="BrowserGuestModeEnforced_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Brave enforces guest sessions and prevents profile sign-ins. Guest sign-ins are Brave profiles where windows are in Incognito mode.

Setting the policy to Disabled, leaving it unset, or disabling browser Guest mode (through BrowserGuestModeEnabled) allows the use of new and existing profiles.</string>
      <string id="BrowserLabsEnabled">Browser experiments icon in toolbar</string>
      <string id="BrowserLabsEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving the policy unset means that users can access browser experimental features through an icon in the toolbar

Setting the policy to Disabled removes the browser experimental features icon from the toolbar.

chrome://flags and any other means of turning off and on browser features will still behave as expected regardless of whether this policy is Enabled or Disabled.</string>
      <string id="BrowserNetworkTimeQueriesEnabled">Allow queries to a Google time service</string>
      <string id="BrowserNetworkTimeQueriesEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Brave send occasional queries to a Google server to retrieve an accurate timestamp.

Setting the policy to Disabled stops Brave from sending these queries.</string>
      <string id="BrowserSignin">Browser sign in settings</string>
      <string id="BrowserSignin_Explain">This policy controls the sign-in behavior of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Brave with their account and use account related services like Chrome sync.

If the policy is set to "Disable browser sign-in" then the user can not sign in to the browser and use account based services. In this case browser level features like Chrome sync can not be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set "Disabled" they will be signed out the next time they run Chrome but their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will stay preserved. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

If the policy is set to "Enable browser sign-in," then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome sync, use the "SyncDisabled" policy.

If the policy is set to "Force browser sign-in" the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the "SyncDisabled" policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy.

      <string id="BrowsingDataLifetime_Explain">Configures browsing data lifetime settings for Brave.
This policy controls the time to live of selected browsing data.
The available data types are 'browsing_history', 'download_history', 'cookies_and_other_site_data', 'cached_images_and_files', 'password_signin', 'autofill', 'site_settings' and 'hosted_app_data'.
Chrome will regularly remove data of selected types that is older than 'time_to_live_in_hours'. As this deletion only happens in certain intervals, some data might live for slightly longer but never more than twice its expected 'time_to_live_in_hours'.
This policy requires the SyncDisabled policy to be set to true, otherwise it will be ignored.
If this policy is set at platform level, Sync should be disabled at platform level.
If this policy is set at user level, Sync should be disabled for that user in order for this policy to take effect.

See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=BrowsingDataLifetime for more information about schema and formatting.

      <string id="BuiltInDnsClientEnabled">Use built-in DNS client</string>
      <string id="BuiltInDnsClientEnabled_Explain">This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the Operating System DNS client, or Brave's built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Brave will always use the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the DnsOverHttpsMode policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

If this policy is set to Enabled, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available.

If this policy is set to Disabled, the built-in DNS client will only be used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.

If this policy is left unset, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on macOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and Brave OS.</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas_Explain">Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the hash must meet one of these conditions:

* It's of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.

* It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the certificate chain. That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute.

* It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Brave doesn't trust those certificates.

Example value:

sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
sha256//////////////////////w==</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCasDesc">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas_Explain">Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities (CA) for certificate chains with a specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hash. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the subjectPublicKeyInfo hash must appear in a CA certificate recognized as a Legacy CA. A Legacy CA is publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by Brave, but not Android Open Source Project or Brave OS.

Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Brave doesn't trust those certificates.

      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCasDesc">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs</string>
      <string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls_Explain">Setting the policy turns off Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for the hostnames in the specified URLs. While making it harder to detect misissued certificates, hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed).

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Brave doesn't trust those certificates.

A URL pattern follows this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). However, because the validity of certificates for a given hostname is independent of the scheme, port, or path, Brave only considers the hostname portion of the URL. Wildcard hosts aren't supported.

      <string id="ChromeCleanupEnabled">Enable Chrome Cleanup on Windows</string>
      <string id="ChromeCleanupEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means Chrome Cleanup periodically scans the system for unwanted software and should any be found, will ask the user if they wish to remove it. Manually triggering Chrome Cleanup from chrome://settings is allowed.

Setting the policy to Disabled means Chrome Cleanup won't periodically scan and manual triggering is disabled.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.</string>
      <string id="ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled">Control how Chrome Cleanup reports data to Google</string>
      <string id="ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means if Chrome Cleanup detects unwanted software, it may, in line with policy set by SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled, report about the scan to Google. Chrome Cleanup asks users if they want the cleanup. It sends results to Google.

Setting the policy to Disabled means if Chrome Cleanup detects unwanted software, it won't report about the scan to Google, regardless of the value of SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled. Chrome Cleanup asks users if they want the cleanup. The results aren't reported to Google.

Leaving the policy unset means Chrome Cleanup may, in line with policy set by SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled, report about scans for detecting unwanted software to Google. Chrome Cleanup asks users if they want the cleanup and to share the results with Google to help with future unwanted software detection. These results have file metadata, automatically installed extensions, and registry keys, as described by the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper.

      <string id="ChromeVariations">Determine the availability of variations</string>
      <string id="ChromeVariations_Explain">Configuring this policy allows to specify which variations are allowed to be applied in Brave.

Variations provide a means for offering modifications to Brave without shipping a new version of the browser by selectively enabling or disabling already existing features. See https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Manage_the_Chrome_variations_framework for more information.

Setting the VariationsEnabled (value 0), or leaving the policy not set allows all variations to be applied to the browser.

Setting the CriticalFixesOnly (value 1), allows only variations considered critical security or stability fixes to be applied to Brave.

Setting the VariationsDisabled (value 2), prevent all variations from being applied to the browser. Please note that this mode can potentially prevent the Brave developers from providing critical security fixes in a timely manner and is thus not recommended.</string>
      <string id="ChromeVariations_VariationsEnabled">Enable all variations</string>

      <string id="ClearBrowsingDataOnExitList">Clear Browsing Data on Exit</string>
      <string id="ClearBrowsingDataOnExitList_Explain">Configures a list of browsing data types that should be deleted when the browser is closed.
The available data types are browsing history (browsing_history), download history (download_history), cookies (cookies_and_other_site_data), cache(cached_images_and_files), autofill (autofill), passwords (password_signin), site settings (site_settings) and hosted apps data (hosted_app_data).
This policy does not take precedence over AllowDeletingBrowserHistory.
This policy requires the SyncDisabled policy to be set to true, otherwise it will be ignored.
If this policy is set at platform level, Sync should be disabled at platform level.
If this policy is set at user level, Sync should be disabled for that user in order for this policy to take effect.

      <string id="ClickToCallEnabled_Explain">Enable the Click to Call feature which allows users to send phone numbers from Chrome Desktops to an Android device when the user is Signed-in. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9430554?hl=en.

If this policy is set to enabled, the capability of sending phone numbers to Android devices will be enabled for the Chrome user.

If this policy is set to disabled, the capability of sending phone numbers to Android devices will be disabled for the Chrome user.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If this policy is left unset, the Click to Call feature is enabled by default.</string>
      <string id="CloudManagementEnrollmentMandatory">Enable mandatory cloud management enrollment</string>
      <string id="CloudManagementEnrollmentMandatory_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled mandates Chrome Browser Cloud Management enrollment and blocks Brave launch process if failed.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset renders Chrome Browser Cloud Management optional and doesn't block Brave launch process if failed.

Machine scope cloud policy enrollment on desktop uses this policy. See https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9301891?ref_topic=9301744 for details.</string>
      <string id="CloudManagementEnrollmentToken">The enrollment token of cloud policy on desktop</string>
      <string id="CloudManagementEnrollmentToken_Explain">Setting the policy means Brave tries to register itself with Chrome Browser Cloud Management. The value of this policy is an enrollment token you can retrieve from the Google Admin console.

See https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9301891?ref_topic=9301744 for details.

Example value: 37185d02-e055-11e7-80c1-9a214cf093ae</string>
      <string id="CloudPolicyOverridesPlatformPolicy">Brave cloud policy overrides Platform policy.</string>
      <string id="CloudPolicyOverridesPlatformPolicy_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means cloud policy takes precedence if it conflicts with platform policy.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means platform policy takes precedence if it conflicts with cloud policy.

This mandatory policy affects machine scope cloud policies.</string>
      <string id="CommandLineFlagSecurityWarningsEnabled">Enable security warnings for command-line flags</string>
      <string id="CommandLineFlagSecurityWarningsEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means security warnings appear when potentially dangerous command-line flags are used to launch Chrome.

Setting the policy to Disabled prevents security warnings from appearing when Chrome is launched with potentially dangerous command-line flags.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. On macOS, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.</string>
      <string id="ComponentUpdatesEnabled">Enable component updates in Brave</string>
      <string id="ComponentUpdatesEnabled_Explain">Enables component updates for all components in Brave when not set or set to True.

If set to False, updates to components are disabled. However, some components are exempt from this policy: updates to any component that does not contain executable code, or does not significantly alter the behavior of the browser, or is critical for its security will not be disabled.
Examples of such components include the certificate revocation lists and Safe Browsing data.
See https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing for more info on Safe Browsing.</string>
      <string id="DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled">DNS interception checks enabled</string>
      <string id="DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled_Explain">This policy configures a local switch that can be used to disable DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

This detection may not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known, since it causes some amount of DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

When this policy is not set, or is enabled, the DNS interception checks are performed. When explicitly disabled, they're not.</string>
      <string id="DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled">Set Brave as Default Browser</string>
      <string id="DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True has Brave always check whether it's the default browser on startup and, if possible, automatically register itself. Setting the policy to False stops Brave from ever checking if it's the default and turns user controls off for this option.

Leaving the policy unset means Brave lets users control whether it's the default and, if not, whether user notifications should appear.

Note: For Microsoft®Windows® administrators, turning this setting on only works for machines running Windows 7. For later versions, you must deploy a "default application associations" file that makes Brave the handler for the https and http protocols (and, optionally, the ftp protocol and other file formats). See Chrome Help ( https://support.google.com/chrome?p=make_chrome_default_win ).</string>
      <string id="DefaultDownloadDirectory">Set default download directory</string>
      <string id="DefaultDownloadDirectory_Explain">Setting the policy changes the default directory that Chrome downloads files to, but users can change the directory.

Leaving the policy unset means Chrome uses its platform-specific default directory.

Note: See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

Example value: /home/${user_name}/Downloads</string>
      <string id="DefaultSearchProviderContextMenuAccessAllowed">Allow default search provider context menu search access</string>
      <string id="DefaultSearchProviderContextMenuAccessAllowed_Explain">Enables the use of a default search provider on the context menu.

If you set this policy to disabled the search context menu item that relies on your default search provider will not be available.

If this policy is set to enabled or not set, the context menu item for your default search provider will be available.

The policy value is only appled when the DefaultSearchProviderEnabled policy is enabled, and is not applicable otherwise.</string>
      <string id="DeveloperToolsAvailability">Control where Developer Tools can be used</string>
      <string id="DeveloperToolsAvailability_Explain">Setting the policy to 0 (the default) means you can access the developer tools and the JavaScript console, but not in the context of extensions installed by enterprise policy. Setting the policy to 1 means you can access the developer tools and the JavaScript console in all contexts, including that of extensions installed by enterprise policy. Setting the policy to 2 means you can't acess developer tools, and you can't inspect website elements.

This setting also turns off keyboard shortcuts and menu or context menu entries to open developer tools or the JavaScript console.</string>
      <string id="DeveloperToolsAvailability_DeveloperToolsDisallowedForForceInstalledExtensions">Disallow usage of the Developer Tools on extensions installed by enterprise policy, allow usage of the Developer Tools in other contexts</string>

      <string id="DeveloperToolsAvailability_DeveloperToolsDisallowed">Disallow usage of the Developer Tools</string>
      <string id="Disable3DAPIs">Disable support for 3D graphics APIs</string>
      <string id="Disable3DAPIs_Explain">Setting the policy to True (or setting HardwareAccelerationModeEnabled to False) prevents webpages from accessing the WebGL API, and plugins can't use the Pepper 3D API.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset lets webpages use the WebGL API and plugins use the Pepper 3D API, but the browser's default settings might still require command line arguments to use these APIs.</string>
      <string id="DisableSafeBrowsingProceedAnyway">Disable proceeding from the Safe Browsing warning page</string>
      <string id="DisableSafeBrowsingProceedAnyway_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled prevents users from proceeding past the warning page the Safe Browsing service shows to the malicious site. This policy only prevents users from proceeding on Safe Browsing warnings such as malware and phishing, not for SSL certificate-related issues such as invalid or expired certificates.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means users can choose to proceed to the flagged site after the warning appears.

See more about Safe Browsing ( https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing ).</string>
      <string id="DisableScreenshots">Disable taking screenshots</string>
      <string id="DisableScreenshots_Explain">Setting the policy to True disallows screenshots taken with keyboard shortcuts or extension APIs. Setting the policy to False allows screenshots.</string>
      <string id="DiskCacheDir">Set disk cache directory</string>
      <string id="DiskCacheDir_Explain">Setting the policy has Brave use the directory you provide for storing cached files on the disk—whether or not users specify the --disk-cache-dir flag.

If not set, Brave uses the default cache directory, but users can change that setting with the --disk-cache-dir command line flag.

Brave manages the contents of a volume's root directory. So to avoid data loss or other errors, do not set this policy to the root directory or any directory used for other purposes. See the variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

Example value: ${user_home}/Chrome_cache</string>
      <string id="DiskCacheSize">Set disk cache size in bytes</string>
      <string id="DiskCacheSize_Explain">Setting the policy to None has Brave use the default cache size for storing cached files on the disk. Users can't change it.

If you set the policy, Brave uses the cache size you provide—whether or not users specify the --disk-cache-size flag. (Values below a few megabytes are rounded up.)

If not set, Brave uses the default size. Users can change that setting using the --disk-cache-size flag.</string>
      <string id="DnsOverHttpsMode">Controls the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS</string>
      <string id="DnsOverHttpsMode_Explain">Controls the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Please note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query. The mode may be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

The "off" mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

The "automatic" mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

The "secure" mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

On Android Pie and above, if DNS-over-TLS is active, Brave will not send insecure DNS requests.

If this policy is unset the browser may send DNS-over-HTTPS requests to a resolver associated with the user's configured system resolver.

Example value: off</string>
      <string id="DnsOverHttpsMode_off">Disable DNS-over-HTTPS</string>
      <string id="DnsOverHttpsMode_automatic">Enable DNS-over-HTTPS with insecure fallback</string>

      <string id="DnsOverHttpsTemplates">Specify URI template of desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver</string>
      <string id="DnsOverHttpsTemplates_Explain">The URI template of the desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. To specify multiple DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers, separate the corresponding URI templates with spaces.

If the DnsOverHttpsMode is set to "secure" then this policy must be set and not empty.

If the DnsOverHttpsMode is set to "automatic" and this policy is set then the URI templates specified will be used; if this policy is unset then hardcoded mappings will be used to attempt to upgrade the user's current DNS resolver to a DoH resolver operated by the same provider.

If the URI template contains a dns variable, requests to the resolver will use GET; otherwise requests will use POST.

Incorrectly formatted templates will be ignored.

Example value: https://dns.example.net/dns-query{?dns}</string>
      <string id="DownloadDirectory">Set download directory</string>
      <string id="DownloadDirectory_Explain">Setting the policy sets up the directory Chrome uses for downloading files. It uses the provided directory, whether or not users specify one or turned on the flag to be prompted for download location every time.

Leaving the policy unset means Chrome uses the default download directory, and users can change it.

Note: See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

Example value: /home/${user_name}/Downloads</string>
      <string id="DownloadRestrictions">Allow download restrictions</string>
      <string id="DownloadRestrictions_Explain">Setting the policy means users can't bypass download security decisions.

 Setting the policy to:

* Block dangerous downloads means all downloads are allowed, except for those that carry safety warnings.

* Block potentially dangerous downloads means all downloads allowed, except for those that carry safety warnings of potentially dangerous downloads.

* Block all downloads means all downloads are blocked.

* Block malicious downloads means all downloads are allowed, except for those assessed to be malware with high confidence. Unlike with dangerous downloads, this does not take into account file type, but does take into account the host.

* No special restrictions means the downloads go through the usual security restrictions based on safety analysis results.

Note: These restrictions apply to downloads triggered from webpage content, as well as the Download link... menu option. They don't apply to the download of the currently displayed page or to saving as PDF from the printing options.

      <string id="EnableExperimentalPolicies">Enables experimental policies</string>
      <string id="EnableExperimentalPolicies_Explain">Allows Brave to load experimental policies.

WARNING: Experimental policies are unsupported and subject to change or be removed without notice in future version of the browser!

An experimental policy may not be finished or still have known or unknown defects. It may be changed or even removed without any notification. By enabling experimental policies, you could lose browser data or compromise your security or privacy.

If a policy is not in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be ignored on Beta and Stable channel.

If a policy is in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be applied.

This policy has no effect on already released policies.

      <string id="EnableOnlineRevocationChecks">Enable online OCSP/CRL checks</string>
      <string id="EnableOnlineRevocationChecks_Explain">Setting the policy to True means online OCSP/CRL checks are performed.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means Brave won't perform online revocation checks in Brave 19 and later.

Note: OCSP/CRL checks provide no effective security benefit.</string>
      <string id="EnterpriseHardwarePlatformAPIEnabled">Enables managed extensions to use the Enterprise Hardware Platform API</string>
      <string id="EnterpriseHardwarePlatformAPIEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True lets extensions installed by enterprise policy use the Enterprise Hardware Platform API.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset prevents extensions from using this API.

Note: This policy also applies to component extensions, such as the Hangout Services extension.</string>
      <string id="ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox">Show an "Always open" checkbox in external protocol dialog.</string>
      <string id="ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox_Explain">This policy controls whether or not the "Always open" checkbox is shown on external protocol launch confirmation prompts.

     If this policy is set to True or not set, when an external protocol confirmation is shown, the user can select "Always allow" to skip all future confirmation prompts for the protocol on this site.

     If this policy is set to False, the "Always allow" checkbox is not displayed and the user will be prompted each time an external protocol is invoked.</string>
      <string id="ForceEphemeralProfiles">Ephemeral profile</string>
      <string id="ForceEphemeralProfiles_Explain">If set to enabled this policy forces the profile to be switched to ephemeral mode. If this policy is specified as an OS policy (e.g. GPO on Windows) it will apply to every profile on the system; if the policy is set as a Cloud policy it will apply only to a profile signed in with a managed account.

In this mode the profile data is persisted on disk only for the length of the user session. Features like browser history, extensions and their data, web data like cookies and web databases are not preserved after the browser is closed. However this does not prevent the user from downloading any data to disk manually, save pages or print them.

If the user has enabled sync all this data is preserved in their sync profile just like with regular profiles. Incognito mode is also available if not explicitly disabled by policy.

If the policy is set to disabled or left not set signing in leads to regular profiles.</string>
      <string id="ForceGoogleSafeSearch">Force Google SafeSearch</string>
      <string id="ForceGoogleSafeSearch_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means SafeSearch in Google Search is always active, and users can't change this setting.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means SafeSearch in Google Search is not enforced.</string>
      <string id="ForceYouTubeRestrict">Force minimum YouTube Restricted Mode</string>
      <string id="ForceYouTubeRestrict_Explain">Setting the policy enforces a minimum Restricted mode on YouTube and prevents users from picking a less restricted mode. If you set it to:

* Strict, Strict Restricted mode on YouTube is always active.

* Moderate, the user may only pick Moderate Restricted mode and Strict Restricted mode on YouTube, but can't turn off Restricted mode.

* Off or if no value is set, Restricted mode on YouTube isn't enforced by Chrome. External policies such as YouTube policies might still enforce Restricted mode.</string>

      <string id="FullscreenAllowed">Allow fullscreen mode</string>
      <string id="FullscreenAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to True or leaving it unset means that, with appropriate permissions, users, apps, and extensions can enter Fullscreen mode (in which only web content appears).

Setting the policy to False means users, apps, and extensions can't enter Fullscreen mode.</string>
      <string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled">Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache</string>
      <string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled_Explain">This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures, and will be removed in the future.</string>
      <string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList">List of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check</string>
      <string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that are exempt from the HSTS policy check that could upgrade requests from http to https. Only single-label hostnames are allowed in this policy. Hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.

Example value:

      <string id="ImportAutofillFormData">Import autofill form data from default browser on first run</string>
      <string id="ImportAutofillFormData_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled imports autofill form data from the previous default browser on first run. Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means no autofill form data is imported on first run.

Users can trigger an import dialog and the autofill form data checkbox will be checked or unchecked to match this policy's value.</string>
      <string id="ImportBookmarks">Import bookmarks from default browser on first run</string>
      <string id="ImportBookmarks_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled imports bookmarks from the previous default browser on first run. Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means no bookmarks are imported on first run.

      <string id="InsecureFormsWarningsEnabled">Enable warnings for insecure forms</string>
      <string id="InsecureFormsWarningsEnabled_Explain">This policy controls the treatment for insecure forms (forms that submit over HTTP) embedded in secure (HTTPS) sites in the browser.
If the policy is enabled or unset, a full page warning will be shown when an insecure form is submitted. Additionally, a warning bubble will be shown next to the form fields when they are focused, and autofill will be disabled for those forms.
If the policy is disabled, warnings will not be shown for insecure forms, and autofill will work normally.</string>
      <string id="IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled">Control the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature.</string>
      <string id="IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled_Explain">When enabled the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature causes Javascript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced, running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5 minutes or more.

This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality
on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a
minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when
enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

If this policy is set to enabled then the feature will be force enabled, and
users will not be able to override this.

If this policy is set to disabled then the feature will be force disabled, and
users will not be able to override this.

If this policy is left unset then the feature will be controlled by its
own internal logic, which can be manually configured by users.

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent
value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full
restart is required to ensure that all loaded tabs receive a consistent
policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different
values of this policy.
</string>
      <string id="IntranetRedirectBehavior">Intranet Redirection Behavior</string>
      <string id="IntranetRedirectBehavior_Explain">This policy configures behavior for intranet redirection via DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

If this policy is not set, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled is a related policy that may also disable DNS interception checks; this policy is a more flexible version which may separately control intranet redirection infobars and may be expanded in the future.
If either DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled or this policy requests to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.</string>

      <string id="IsolateOrigins">Enable Site Isolation for specified origins</string>
      <string id="IsolateOrigins_Explain">Setting the policy means each of the named origins in a comma-separated list runs in its own process, and it isolates origins named by subdomains. For example, specifying https://example.com/ isolates https://foo.example.com/ as part of the https://example.com/ site.

Setting it to off or leaving it unset lets users change this setting.

Note: For Android, use the IsolateOriginsAndroid policy instead.

Example value: https://example.com/,https://othersite.org/</string>
      <string id="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomains">Suppress lookalike domain warnings on domains</string>
      <string id="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomains_Explain">This policy prevents the display of lookalike URL warnings on the sites listed. These warnings are typically shown on sites that Brave believes might be trying to spoof another site the user is familiar with.

If the policy is enabled and set to one or more domains, no lookalike warnings pages will be shown when the user visits pages on that domain.

If the policy is disabled, not set, or set to an empty list, warnings may appear on any site the user visits.

A hostname can be allowed with a complete host match, or any domain match. For example, a URL like "https://foo.example.com/bar" may have warnings suppressed if this list includes either "foo.example.com" or "example.com".

Example value:

foo.example.com
example.org</string>
      <string id="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomainsDesc">Suppress lookalike domain warnings on domains</string>
      <string id="ManagedBookmarks">Managed Bookmarks</string>
      <string id="ManagedBookmarks_Explain">Setting the policy sets up a list of bookmarks where each one is a dictionary with the keys "name" and "url". These keys hold the bookmark's name and target. Admins can set up a subfolder by defining a bookmark without a "url" key, but with an additional "children" key. This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, "google.com" becomes "https://google.com/".

Users can't change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is "Managed bookmarks" but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named "toplevel_name" with the desired folder name as its value. Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and extensions can't modify them.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ManagedBookmarks for more information about schema and formatting.

      <string id="ManagedConfigurationPerOrigin">Sets managed configuration values to websites to specific origins</string>
      <string id="ManagedConfigurationPerOrigin_Explain">Setting the policy defines the return value of Managed Configuration API for given origin.

 Managed configuration API is a key-value configuration that can be accessed via navigator.device.getManagedConfiguration() javascript call. This API is only available to origins which correspond to force-installed web applications via WebAppInstallForceList.

]</string>
      <string id="MaxConnectionsPerProxy">Maximal number of concurrent connections to the proxy server</string>
      <string id="MaxConnectionsPerProxy_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the maximal number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server. Some proxy servers can't handle a high number of concurrent connections per client, which is solved by setting this policy to a lower value. The value should be lower than 100 and higher than 6. Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs, so setting a value below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if there are too many web apps with hanging connections open. Lower below the default at your own risk.

Leaving the policy unset means a default of 32 is used.</string>
      <string id="MaxInvalidationFetchDelay">Maximum fetch delay after a policy invalidation</string>
      <string id="MaxInvalidationFetchDelay_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the maximum delay in milliseconds between receiving a policy invalidation and fetching the new policy from the device management service. Valid values range from 1,000 (1 second) to 300,000 (5 minutes). Values outside this range will be clamped to the respective boundary.

Leaving the policy unset means Brave uses the default value of 10 seconds.</string>
      <string id="MediaRecommendationsEnabled">Enable Media Recommendations</string>
      <string id="MediaRecommendationsEnabled_Explain">By default the browser will show media recommendations that are personalized to the user. Setting this policy to Disabled will result in these recommendations being hidden from the user. Setting this policy to Enabled or leaving it unset will result in the media recommendations being shown to the user.</string>
      <string id="MediaRouterCastAllowAllIPs">Allow Google Cast to connect to Cast devices on all IP addresses.</string>
      <string id="MediaRouterCastAllowAllIPs_Explain">Unless EnableMediaRouter is set to Disabled, setting MediaRouterCastAllowAllIPs to Enabled connects Google Cast to Cast devices on all IP addresses, not just RFC1918/RFC4193 private addresses.

Setting the policy to Disabled connects Google Cast to Cast devices only on RFC1918/RFC4193.

Leaving the policy unset connects Google Cast to Cast devices only on RFC1918/RFC4193, unless the CastAllowAllIPs feature is turned on.</string>
      <string id="MetricsReportingEnabled">Enable reporting of usage and crash-related data</string>
      <string id="MetricsReportingEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled turns on anonymous reporting of usage and crash-related data about Chrome to Google and prevents users from changing this setting. Setting the policy to Disabled means this information is not sent to Google.

If you set the policy, users can't change it. If not set, users choose the behavior at installation or first run.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain. or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management and macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

(For Chrome OS, see DeviceMetricsReportingEnabled.)</string>
      <string id="NTPCardsVisible">Show cards on the New Tab Page</string>
      <string id="NTPCardsVisible_Explain">This policy controls the visibility of cards on the New Tab Page. Cards surface entry points to launch common user journeys based on the user's browsing behavior.

If the policy is set to Enabled, the New Tab Page will show cards if content is available.

If the policy is set to Disabled, the New Tab Page won't show cards.

If the policy is not set, the user can control the card visibility. The default is visible.
</string>
      <string id="NTPCustomBackgroundEnabled">Allow users to customize the background on the New Tab page</string>
      <string id="NTPCustomBackgroundEnabled_Explain">If the policy is set to false, the New Tab page won't allow users to customize the background. Any existing custom background will be permanently removed even if the policy is set to true later.

If the policy is set to true or unset, users can customize the background on the New Tab page.</string>
      <string id="NativeWindowOcclusionEnabled">Enable Native Window Occlusion</string>
      <string id="NativeWindowOcclusionEnabled_Explain">Enables native window occlusion in Brave.

If you enable this setting, to reduce CPU and power consumption Brave will detect when a window is covered by other windows, and will suspend work painting pixels.

If you disable this setting Brave will not detect when a window is covered by other windows.

If this policy is left not set, occlusion detection will be enabled.</string>
      <string id="NetworkPredictionOptions">Enable network prediction</string>
      <string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_Explain">This policy controls network prediction in Brave. It controls DNS prefetching, TCP, and SSL preconnection and prerendering of webpages.

If you set the policy, users can't change it. Leaving it unset turns on network prediction, but the user can change it.</string>
      <string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionAlways">Predict network actions on any network connection</string>
      <string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionWifiOnly">Predict network actions on any network that is not cellular.

      <string id="NetworkPredictionOptions_NetworkPredictionNever">Do not predict network actions on any network connection</string>
      <string id="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin">Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on
insecure origins should not apply</string>
      <string id="OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as *.example.com) for which security restrictions on insecure origins won't apply. Organizations can specify origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development, so developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the address bar.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. The policy overrides the command-line flag and UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

For more information on secure contexts, see Secure Contexts ( https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts ).

Example value:

http://testserver.example.com/

insecure origins should not apply</string>
      <string id="PaymentMethodQueryEnabled">Allow websites to query for available payment methods.</string>
      <string id="PaymentMethodQueryEnabled_Explain">Allows you to set whether websites are allowed to check if the user has payment methods saved.

If this policy is set to disabled, websites that use PaymentRequest.canMakePayment or PaymentRequest.hasEnrolledInstrument API will be informed that no payment methods are available.

If the setting is enabled or not set then websites are allowed to check if the user has payment methods saved.</string>
      <string id="PolicyAtomicGroupsEnabled">Enables the concept of policy atomic groups</string>
      <string id="PolicyAtomicGroupsEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means policies coming from an atomic group that don't share the source with the highest priority from that group get ignored.

Setting the policy to Disabled means no policy is ignored because of its source. Policies are ignored only if there's a conflict, and the policy doesn't have the highest priority.

If this policy is set from a cloud source, it can't target a specific user.</string>
      <string id="PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList">Allow merging dictionary policies from different sources</string>
      <string id="PolicyDictionaryMultipleSourceMergeList_Explain">Setting the policy allows merging of selected policies when they come from different sources, with the same scopes and level. This merging is in the first level keys of the dictionary from each source. The key coming from the highest priority source takes precedence.

If a policy is in the list and there's conflict between sources with:

* The same scopes and level: The values merge into a new policy dictionary.

* Different scopes or level: The policy with the highest priority applies.

If a policy isn't in the list and there's conflict between sources, scopes, or level, the policy with the highest priority applies.

Example value:

ExtensionSettings</string>

      <string id="PolicyRefreshRate">Refresh rate for user policy</string>
      <string id="PolicyRefreshRate_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the period in milliseconds at which the device management service is queried for user policy information. Valid values range from 1,800,000 (30 minutes) to 86,400,000 (1 day). Values outside this range will be clamped to the respective boundary.

Leaving the policy unset uses the default value of 3 hours.

Note: Policy notifications force a refresh when the policy changes, making frequent refreshes unnecessary. So, if the platform supports these notifications, the refresh delay is 24 hours (ignoring defaults and the value of this policy).</string>
      <string id="ProfilePickerOnStartupAvailability">Profile picker availabily on startup</string>
      <string id="ProfilePickerOnStartupAvailability_Explain">Specifies whether the profile picker is enabled, disabled or forced at the browser startup.

By default the profile picker is not shown if the browser starts in guest or incognito mode, a profile directory and/or urls are specified by command line, an app is explicitly requested to open, the browser was launched by a native notification, there is only one profile available or the policy ForceBrowserSignin is set to true.

If 'Enabled' (0) is selected or the policy is left unset, the profile picker will be shown at startup by default, but users will be able to enable/disable it.

If 'Disabled' (1) is selected, the profile picker will never be shown, and users will not be able to change the setting.

If 'Forced' (2) is selected, the profile picker cannot be suppressed by the user. The profile picker will be shown even if there is only one profile available.</string>
      <string id="ProfilePickerOnStartupAvailability_Enabled">Profile picker available at startup</string>

      <string id="PromotionalTabsEnabled">Enable showing full-tab promotional content</string>
      <string id="PromotionalTabsEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True or leaving it unset lets Brave show users product information as full-tab content.

Setting the policy to False prevents Brave from showing product information as full-tab content.

Setting the policy controls the presentation of the welcome pages that help users sign in to Brave, set Brave as users' default browser, or otherwise inform them of product features.</string>
      <string id="PromptForDownloadLocation">Ask where to save each file before downloading</string>
      <string id="PromptForDownloadLocation_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means users are asked where to save each file before downloading. Setting the policy to Disabled has downloads start immediately, and users aren't asked where to save the file.

Leaving the policy unset lets users change this setting.</string>
      <string id="ProxySettings">Proxy settings</string>
      <string id="ProxySettings_Explain">Setting the policy configures the proxy settings for Chrome and ARC-apps, which ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

 Leaving the policy unset lets users choose their proxy settings.

 Setting the ProxySettings policy accepts the following fields:
   * ProxyMode, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings
   * ProxyPacUrl, a URL to a proxy .pac file
   * ProxyServer, a URL of the proxy server
   * ProxyBypassList, a list of proxy hosts that Brave bypasses

 The ProxyServerMode field is deprecated in favor of the ProxyMode field, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

  For ProxyMode, if you choose the value:
    * direct, a proxy is never used and all other fields are ignored.
    * system, the systems's proxy is used and all other fields are ignored.
    * auto_detect, all other fields are ignored.
    * fixed_server, the ProxyServer and ProxyBypassList fields are used.
    * pac_script, the ProxyPacUrl and ProxyBypassList fields are used.

Setting the policy to Disabled disallows the use of QUIC protocol.</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotification">Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotification_Explain">Notify users that Brave must be relaunched or Brave OS must be restarted to apply a pending update.

This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, Brave indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while Brave OS indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for Brave and four days for Brave OS, and may be configured via the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy setting.

The user's session is restored following the relaunch/restart.</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotification_Recommended">Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is recommended</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotification_Required">Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is required</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod">Set the time period for update notifications</string>
      <string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod_Explain">Allows you to set the time period, in milliseconds, over which users are notified that Brave must be relaunched or that a Brave OS device must be restarted to apply a pending update.

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Brave OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Brave browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

If not set, the default period of 604800000 milliseconds (one week) is used.</string>
      <string id="RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled">Enable Renderer Code Integrity</string>
      <string id="RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns Renderer Code Integrity on.

Setting the policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on Brave's security and stability as unknown and potentially hostile code can load inside Brave's renderer processes. Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third-party software that must run inside Brave's renderer processes.

Note: Read more about Process mitigation policies ( https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md#Process-mitigation-policies ).</string>
      <string id="RequireOnlineRevocationChecksForLocalAnchors">Require online OCSP/CRL checks for local trust anchors</string>
      <string id="RequireOnlineRevocationChecksForLocalAnchors_Explain">Setting the policy to True means Brave always performs revocation checking for successfully validated server certificates signed by locally installed CA certificates. If Brave can't get revocation status information, Brave treats these certificates as revoked (hard-fail).

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means Brave uses existing online revocation-checking settings.</string>
      <string id="RestrictSigninToPattern">Restrict which Google accounts are allowed to be set as browser primary accounts in Brave</string>
      <string id="RestrictSigninToPattern_Explain">Contains a regular expression which is used to determine which Google accounts can be set as browser primary accounts in Brave (i.e. the account that is chosen during the Sync opt-in flow).

An appropriate error is displayed if a user tries to set a browser primary account with a username that does not match this pattern.

If this policy is left not set or blank, then the user can set any Google account as a browser primary account in Brave.

Example value: .*@example.com</string>
      <string id="RoamingProfileLocation">Set the roaming profile directory</string>
      <string id="RoamingProfileLocation_Explain">Configures the directory that Brave will use for storing the roaming copy of the profiles.

If you set this policy, Brave will use the provided directory to store the roaming copy of the profiles if the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy has been enabled. If the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy is disabled or left unset the value stored in this policy is not used.

See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables for a list of variables that can be used.

On non-Windows platforms, this policy must be set for roaming profiles to work.

On Windows, if this policy is left unset, the default roaming profile path will be used.

Example value: ${roaming_app_data}\chrome-profile</string>
      <string id="RoamingProfileSupportEnabled">Enable the creation of roaming copies for Brave profile data</string>
      <string id="RoamingProfileSupportEnabled_Explain">If you enable this setting, the settings stored in Brave profiles like bookmarks, autofill data, passwords, etc. will also be written to a file stored in the Roaming user profile folder or a location specified by the Administrator through the RoamingProfileLocation policy. Enabling this policy disables cloud sync.

If this policy is disabled or left not set only the regular local profiles will be used.</string>
      <string id="RunAllFlashInAllowMode">Extend Flash content setting to all content</string>
      <string id="RunAllFlashInAllowMode_Explain">Setting the policy to True runs all Flash content embedded on websites that allow Flash, including content from other origins or small content.

Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset might block Flash content from other origins or small content.

Note: To control which websites can run Flash, see these policies: DefaultPluginsSetting, PluginsAllowedForUrls, and PluginsBlockedForUrls.</string>
      <string id="SSLErrorOverrideAllowed">Allow proceeding from the SSL warning page</string>
      <string id="SSLErrorOverrideAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users click through warning pages Brave shows when users navigate to sites that have SSL errors.

Setting the policy to Disabled prevent users from clicking through any warning pages.</string>
      <string id="SSLVersionMin">Minimum SSL version enabled</string>
      <string id="SSLVersionMin_Explain">Warning: Support for suppressing the TLS 1.0/1.1 warning will be removed from Brave starting in version 91 (around May 2021) and this policy will stop working then.

Setting the policy to a valid value means Brave won't use SSL/TLS versions less than the specified version. Unrecognized values are ignored.

If this policy is not set, then Brave will show an error for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, but the user will be able to bypass it.

Example value: tls1</string>
      <string id="SSLVersionMin_TLSv1">TLS 1.0</string>
      <string id="SSLVersionMin_TLSv1_1">TLS 1.1</string>
      <string id="SSLVersionMin_TLSv1_2">TLS 1.2</string>
      <string id="SafeBrowsingForTrustedSourcesEnabled">Enable Safe Browsing for trusted sources</string>
      <string id="SafeBrowsingForTrustedSourcesEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means downloaded files are sent to be analyzed by Safe Browsing, even when it's from a trusted source.

Setting the policy to Disabled means downloaded files won't be sent to be analyzed by Safe Browsing when it's from a trusted source.

These restrictions apply to downloads triggered from webpage content, as well as the Download link menu option. These restrictions don't apply to the save or download of the currently displayed page or to saving as PDF from the printing options.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. On macOS, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.</string>
      <string id="SafeSitesFilterBehavior">Control SafeSites adult content filtering.</string>
      <string id="SafeSitesFilterBehavior_Explain">Setting the policy controls the SafeSites URL filter, which uses the Google Safe Search API to classify URLs as pornographic or not.

When this policy is set to:

* Do not filter sites for adult content, or not set, sites aren't filtered

* Filter top level sites for adult content, pornographic sites are filtered</string>
      <string id="SafeSitesFilterBehavior_SafeSitesFilterDisabled">Do not filter sites for adult content</string>
      <string id="SafeSitesFilterBehavior_SafeSitesFilterEnabled">Filter top level sites (but not embedded iframes) for adult content</string>
      <string id="SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled">Disable saving browser history</string>
      <string id="SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means browsing history is not saved, tab syncing is off and users can't change this setting.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset saves browsing history.</string>
      <string id="ScreenCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny screen capture</string>
      <string id="ScreenCaptureAllowed_Explain">If enabled or not configured (default), a Web page can use
screen-share APIs (e.g., getDisplayMedia() or the Desktop Capture extension API)
to prompt the user to select a tab, window or desktop to capture.

When this policy is disabled, any calls to screen-share APIs will fail
with an error.</string>
      <string id="ScrollToTextFragmentEnabled">Enable scrolling to text specified in URL fragments</string>
      <string id="ScrollToTextFragmentEnabled_Explain">This feature allows for hyperlinks and address bar URL navigations to target specific text within a web page, which will be scrolled to once the loading of the web page is complete.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, web page scrolling to specific text fragments via URL will be enabled.

If you disable this policy, web page scrolling to specific text fragments via URL will be disabled.</string>
      <string id="SearchSuggestEnabled">Enable search suggestions</string>
      <string id="SearchSuggestEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True turns on search suggestions in Brave's address bar. Setting the policy to False turns off these search suggestions.

If you set the policy, users can't change it. If not set, search suggestions are on at first, but users can turn them off any time.</string>
      <string id="SecurityKeyPermitAttestation">URLs/domains automatically permitted direct Security Key attestation</string>
      <string id="SecurityKeyPermitAttestation_Explain">Setting the policy specifies URLs and domains for which no prompt appears when attestation certificates from Security Keys are requested. A signal is also sent to the Security Key indicating that individual attestation may be used. Without this, when sites request attestation of Security Keys, users are prompted in Brave version 65 and later.

URLs will only match as U2F appIDs. Domains only match as webauthn RP IDs. So to cover both U2F and webauthn APIs, list the appID URL and domain for a given site.

Example value:

https://example.com</string>
      <string id="SecurityKeyPermitAttestationDesc">URLs/domains automatically permitted direct Security Key attestation</string>
      <string id="SharedClipboardEnabled">Enable the Shared Clipboard Feature</string>
      <string id="SharedClipboardEnabled_Explain">Enable the Shared Clipboard feature which allows users to send text between Chrome Desktops and an Android device when Sync is enabled and the user is Signed-in.

If this policy is set to true, the capability of sending text, cross device, for chrome user is enabled.

If this policy is set to false, the capability of sending text, cross device, for chrome user is disabled.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If this policy is left unset, the shared clipboard feature is enabled by default.

It is up to the admins to set policies in all platforms they care about. It's recommended to set this policy to one value in all platforms.</string>
      <string id="ShowAppsShortcutInBookmarkBar">Show the apps shortcut in the bookmark bar</string>
      <string id="ShowAppsShortcutInBookmarkBar_Explain">Setting the policy to True displays the apps shortcut. Setting the policy to False means this shortcut never appears.

If you set the policy, users can't change it. If not set, users decide to show or hide the apps shortcut from the bookmark bar context menu.</string>
      <string id="ShowFullUrlsInAddressBar">Show Full URLs</string>
      <string id="ShowFullUrlsInAddressBar_Explain">This feature enables display of the full URL in the address bar.
If this policy is set to True, then the full URL will be shown in the address bar, including schemes and subdomains.
If this policy is set to False, then the default URL display will apply.
If this policy is left unset, then the default URL display will apply and the user will be able to toggle between default and full URL display with a context menu option.
</string>
      <string id="SignedHTTPExchangeEnabled">Enable Signed HTTP Exchange (SXG) support</string>
      <string id="SignedHTTPExchangeEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True or leaving it unset means Brave will accept web contents served as Signed HTTP Exchanges.

Setting the policy to False prevents Signed HTTP Exchanges from loading.</string>
      <string id="SigninInterceptionEnabled">Enable signin interception</string>
      <string id="SigninInterceptionEnabled_Explain">This settings enables or disables signin interception.

When this policy not set or is set to True, the signin interception dialog triggers when a Google account is added on the web, and the user may benefit from moving this account to another (new or existing) profile.

When this is set to False, the signin interception dialog does not trigger.</string>
      <string id="SitePerProcess">Enable Site Isolation for every site</string>
      <string id="SitePerProcess_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled isolates all sites. (Each site runs in its own process.) Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset doesn't turn off site isolation, but it lets users opt out (for example, by using Disable site isolation in chrome://flags).

IsolateOrigins might also be useful for fine-tuning origins. On Brave OS version 76 and earlier, set the DeviceLoginScreenSitePerProcess device policy to the same value. (Because if the values don't match, a delay can occur when entering a user session.)

Note: For Android, use the SitePerProcessAndroid policy instead.</string>
      <string id="SpellCheckServiceEnabled">Enable or disable spell checking web service</string>
      <string id="SpellCheckServiceEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled puts a Google web service in use to help resolve spelling errors. This policy only controls the use of the online service. Setting the policy to Disabled means this service is never used.

Leaving the policy unset lets users choose whether to use the spellcheck service.

The spell check can always use a downloaded dictionary locally unless the feature is disabled by SpellcheckEnabled in which case this policy will have no effect.</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckEnabled">Enable spellcheck</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled turns spellcheck on, and users can't turn it off. On Microsoft® Windows®, Brave OS and Linux®, spellcheck languages can be switched on or off individually, so users can still turn spellcheck off by switching off every spellcheck language. To avoid that, use the SpellcheckLanguage to force-enable specific spellcheck languages.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off spellcheck from all sources, and users can't turn it on. The SpellCheckServiceEnabled, SpellcheckLanguage and SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist policies have no effect when this policy is set to False.

Leaving the policy unset lets users turn spellcheck on or off in the language settings.</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckLanguage">Force enable spellcheck languages</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckLanguage_Explain">Force-enables spellcheck languages. Unrecognized languages in the list will be ignored.

If you enable this policy, spellcheck will be enabled for the languages specified, in addition to the languages for which the user has enabled spellcheck.

If you do not set this policy, or disable it, there will be no change to the user's spellcheck preferences.

If the SpellcheckEnabled policy is set to false, this policy will have no effect.

If a language is included in both this policy and the SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist policy, this policy is prioritized and the spellcheck language is enabled.

The currently supported languages are: af, bg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en-AU, en-CA, en-GB, en-US, es, es-419, es-AR, es-ES, es-MX, es-US, et, fa, fo, fr, he, hi, hr, hu, id, it, ko, lt, lv, nb, nl, pl, pt-BR, pt-PT, ro, ru, sh, sk, sl, sq, sr, sv, ta, tg, tr, uk, vi.

Example value:

      <string id="SpellcheckLanguageDesc">Force enable spellcheck languages</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist">Force disable spellcheck languages</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist_Explain">Force-disables spellcheck languages. Unrecognized languages in that list will be ignored.

If you enable this policy, spellcheck will be disabled for the languages specified. The user can still enable or disable spellcheck for languages not in the list.

If you do not set this policy, or disable it, there will be no change to the user's spellcheck preferences.

If the SpellcheckEnabled policy is set to false, this policy will have no effect.

If a language is included in both this policy and the SpellcheckLanguage policy, the latter is prioritized and the spellcheck language will be enabled.

The currently supported languages are: af, bg, ca, cs, da, de, el, en-AU, en-CA, en-GB, en-US, es, es-419, es-AR, es-ES, es-MX, es-US, et, fa, fo, fr, he, hi, hr, hu, id, it, ko, lt, lv, nb, nl, pl, pt-BR, pt-PT, ro, ru, sh, sk, sl, sq, sr, sv, ta, tg, tr, uk, vi.

Example value:

fr
es</string>
      <string id="SpellcheckLanguageBlocklistDesc">Force disable spellcheck languages</string>
      <string id="SuppressUnsupportedOSWarning">Suppress the unsupported OS warning</string>
      <string id="SuppressUnsupportedOSWarning_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled suppresses the warning that appears when Brave is running on an unsupported computer or operating system.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the warnings appear on unsupported systems.</string>
      <string id="SyncDisabled">Disable synchronization of data with Google</string>
      <string id="SyncDisabled_Explain">Disables data synchronization in Brave using Google-hosted synchronization services and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Brave.

If this policy is left not set Google Sync will be available for the user to choose whether to use it or not.

To fully disable Google Sync, it is recommended that you disable the Google Sync service in the Google Admin console.</string>
      <string id="SyncTypesListDisabled">List of types that should be excluded from synchronization</string>
      <string id="SyncTypesListDisabled_Explain">If this policy is set all specified data types will be excluded from synchronization both for Google Sync as well as for roaming profile synchronization. This can be beneficial to reduce the size of the roaming profile or limit the type of data uploaded to the Google Sync Servers.

The current data types for this policy are: "bookmarks", "preferences", "passwords", "autofill", "themes", "typedUrls", "extensions", "apps", "tabs", "wifiConfigurations". Those names are case sensitive!

Example value:

bookmarks</string>
      <string id="SyncTypesListDisabledDesc">List of types that should be excluded from synchronization</string>
      <string id="TargetBlankImpliesNoOpener">Do not set window.opener for links targeting _blank</string>
      <string id="TargetBlankImpliesNoOpener_Explain">Setting the policy to Disabled allows popups targeting _blank to access (via JavaScript) the page that requested to open the popup.

Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset causes the window.opener property to be set to null unless the anchor specifies rel="opener".

This policy will be removed in Brave version 95.

See https://chromestatus.com/feature/6140064063029248.</string>
      <string id="TaskManagerEndProcessEnabled">Enable ending processes in Task Manager</string>
      <string id="TaskManagerEndProcessEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Disabled prevents users from ending processes in the Task Manager.

Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users end processes in the Task Manager.</string>
      <string id="ThirdPartyBlockingEnabled">Enable third party software injection blocking</string>
      <string id="ThirdPartyBlockingEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset prevents third-party software from injecting executable code into Brave's processes.

Setting the policy to Disabled allows this software to inject such code into Brave's processes.

Regardless of the value of this policy, the browser won't block third-party software from injecting executable code into its processes on a machine that's joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain.</string>
      <string id="TotalMemoryLimitMb">Set limit on megabytes of memory a single Chrome instance can use.</string>
      <string id="TotalMemoryLimitMb_Explain">Configures the amount of memory that a single Brave instance can use before tabs start being discarded (I.E. the memory used by the tab will be freed and the tab will have to be reloaded when switched to) to save memory.

If the policy is set, browser will begin to discard tabs to save memory once the limitation is exceeded. However, there is no guarantee that the browser is always running under the limit. Any value under 1024 will be rounded up to 1024.

If this policy is not set, the browser will only begin attempts to save memory once it has detected that the amount of physical memory on its machine is low.</string>
      <string id="TranslateEnabled">Enable Translate</string>
      <string id="TranslateEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to True provides translation functionality when it's appropriate for users by showing an integrated translate toolbar in Brave and a translate option on the right-click context menu. Setting the policy to False shuts off all built-in translate features.

If you set the policy, users can't change this function. Leaving it unset lets them change the setting.</string>
      <string id="URLAllowlist">Allow access to a list of URLs</string>
      <string id="URLAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy provides access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to URLBlocklist. See that policy's description for the format of entries of this list. For example, setting URLBlocklist to * will block all requests, and you can use this policy to allow access to a limited list of URLs. Use it to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths, using the format specified at ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The URLAllowlist policy takes precedence over URLBlocklist. This policy is limited to 1,000 entries.

This policy also allows enabling the automatic invocation by the browser of external application registered as protocol handlers for the listed protocols like "tel:" or "ssh:".

Leaving the policy unset allows no exceptions to URLBlocklist.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. On macOS, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/good_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com</string>
      <string id="URLAllowlistDesc">Allow access to a list of URLs</string>
      <string id="URLBlocklist">Block access to a list of URLs</string>
      <string id="URLBlocklist_Explain">Setting the policy prevents webpages with prohibited URLs from loading. It provides a list of URL patterns that specify forbidden URLs. Leaving the policy unset means no URLs are prohibited in the browser. Format the URL pattern according to this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). Up to 1,000 exceptions can be defined in URLAllowlist.

From Brave version 73, you can block javascript://* URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript entered in the address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). In-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data aren't subject to this policy. For example, if you block example.com/abc, then example.com can still load example.com/abc using XMLHTTPRequest.

Note: Blocking internal chrome://* URLs can lead to unexpected errors.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/bad_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com
file://*
custom_scheme:*
*</string>
      <string id="URLBlocklistDesc">Block access to a list of URLs</string>
      <string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled">Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection</string>
      <string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means URL-keyed anonymized data collection, which sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better, is always active.

Setting the policy to Disabled results in no URL-keyed anonymized data collection.

If you set the policy, users can't change. If not set, then URL-keyed anonymized data collection at first, but users can change it.</string>
      <string id="UserAgentClientHintsEnabled">Control the User-Agent Client Hints feature.</string>
      <string id="UserAgentClientHintsEnabled_Explain">When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers providing information about the user browser and environment.

This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.

If this policy is enabled or not set the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If the policy is disabled the feature is unavailable.

This enterprise policy is for short-term adaptation purposes and will be available at least until Chrome 91.</string>
      <string id="UserDataDir">Set user data directory</string>
      <string id="UserDataDir_Explain">Configures the directory that Brave will use for storing user data.

If you set this policy, Brave will use the provided directory regardless whether the user has specified the '--user-data-dir' flag or not. To avoid data loss or other unexpected errors this policy should not be set to a directory used for other purposes, because Brave manages its contents.

See https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Supported_directory_variables for a list of variables that can be used.

If this policy is left not set the default profile path will be used and the user will be able to override it with the '--user-data-dir' command line flag.

Example value: ${users}/${user_name}/Chrome</string>
      <string id="UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit">Limits the number of user data snapshots retained for use in case of emergency rollback.</string>
      <string id="UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit_Explain">Following each major version update, Chrome will create a snapshot of certain portions of the user's browsing data for use in case of a later emergency version rollback. If an emergency rollback is performed to a version for which a user has a corresponding snapshot, the data in the snapshot is restored. This allows users to retain such settings as bookmarks and autofill data.

If this policy is not set, the default value of 3 is used

If the policy is set, old snapshots are deleted as needed to respect the limit. If the policy is set to 0, no snapshots will be taken</string>
      <string id="UserFeedbackAllowed">Allow user feedback</string>
      <string id="UserFeedbackAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users send feedback to Google through Menu &gt; Help &gt; Report an Issue or key combination.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't send feedback to Google.</string>
      <string id="VideoCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny video capture</string>
      <string id="VideoCaptureAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means that, with the exception of URLs set in the VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list, users get prompted for video capture access.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off prompts, and video capture is only available to URLs set in the VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list.

Note: The policy affects all video input (not just the built-in camera).</string>
      <string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string>
      <string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Setting the policy means you specify the URL list whose patterns get matched to the security origin of the requesting URL. A match grants access to video capture devices without prompt

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

Example value:

https://www.example.com/
https://[*.]example.edu/</string>
      <string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrlsDesc">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string>
      <string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled">Enable WPAD optimization</string>
      <string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns on WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) optimization in Brave.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off WPAD optimization, causing Brave to wait longer for DNS-based WPAD servers.

Whether or not this policy is set, users can't change the WPAD optimization setting.</string>
      <string id="WebAppInstallForceList">Configure list of force-installed Web Apps</string>
      <string id="WebAppInstallForceList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of web apps that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member: url (the URL of the web app to install) and 2 optional members: default_launch_container (for how the web app opens—a new tab is the default) and create_desktop_shortcut (True if you want to create Linux and Windows® desktop shortcuts).

See PinnedLauncherApps for pinning apps to the Brave OS shelf.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=WebAppInstallForceList for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

[
  {
    "url": "https://www.google.com/maps", 
    "create_desktop_shortcut": true, 
    "default_launch_container": "window"
  }, 
  {
    "url": "https://docs.google.com", 
    "default_launch_container": "tab"
  }
]</string>
      <string id="WebRtcAllowLegacyTLSProtocols">Allow legacy TLS/DTLS downgrade in WebRTC</string>
      <string id="WebRtcAllowLegacyTLSProtocols_Explain">If enabled, WebRTC peer connections can downgrade to obsolete
versions of the TLS/DTLS (DTLS 1.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1) protocols.
When this policy is disabled or not set, these TLS/DTLS versions are
disabled.

This policy is temporary and will be removed in a future version
of Brave.</string>
      <string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed">Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services</string>
      <string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Brave can collect WebRTC event logs from Google services such as Hangouts Meet and upload them to Google. These logs have diagnostic information for debugging issues with audio or video meetings in Brave, such as the time and size of RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs have no audio or video content from the meeting. To make debugging easier, Google might associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself.

Setting the policy to Disabled results in no collection or uploading of such logs.

Leaving the policy unset on versions up to and including M76 means Brave defaults to not being able to collect and upload these logs. Starting at M77, Brave defaults to being able to collect and upload these logs from most profiles affected by cloud-based, user-level enterprise policies. From M77 up to and including M80, Brave can also collect and upload these logs by default from profiles affected by Brave on-premise management.</string>
      <string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls">URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates</string>
      <string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls_Explain">Patterns in this list will be matched against the security origin of the requesting URL.
If a match is found or chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns is Disabled, the local IP addresses are shown in WebRTC ICE candidates.
Otherwise, local IP addresses are concealed with mDNS hostnames.
Please note that this policy weakens the protection of local IPs if needed by administrators.

Example value:

https://www.example.com
*example.com*</string>
      <string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrlsDesc">URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates</string>
      <string id="WebRtcUdpPortRange">Restrict the range of local UDP ports used by WebRTC</string>
      <string id="WebRtcUdpPortRange_Explain">If the policy is set, the UDP port range used by WebRTC is restricted to the specified port interval (endpoints included).

If the policy is not set, or if it is set to the empty string or an invalid port range, WebRTC is allowed to use any available local UDP port.

Example value: 10000-11999</string>
      <string id="TOR_group">TOR Settings</string>
      <string id="TorDisabled">Disable TOR</string>
      <string id="TorDisabled_Explain">If the policy is enabled, TOR will be disabled and the menu option will be removed after a browser restart. If the policy is not set, or if it is set to default, TOR appears in the menu and is allowed for use.</string>
